		<h3>Statement Of Faith</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>The Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the
				inspired word of God, without error in the original writings, the
				complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men, and the
				divine and final authority for all Christian faith and life.</li>
			<li>In one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and
				eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and the Holy
				Spirit.</li>
			<li>That Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been
				conceived of the Holy Ghost and born of the virgin Mary. He died on
				the cross a sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures.
				Further, He arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where,

				at the right hand of the Majesty on High, He now is our high priest
				and advocate.</li>
			<li>That the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord
				Jesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the
				believing sinner, and indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the
				believer for godly living and service.</li>
			<li>That man was created in the image of God but fell into sin
				and is therefore lost and only through regeneration by the Holy
				Spirit can salvation and spiritual life be obtained.</li>
			<li>That the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection
				provide the only ground for justification and salvation for all who
				believe, and only such as receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy
				Spirit, and thus become children of God.</li>
			<li>That water baptism and the Lord’s Supper are ordinances to
				be observed by the Church during the present age. They are however,
				not to be regarded as means of salvation but as an evidence of one's
				commitment to the Lord.</li>
			<li>That the true Church is composed of all such persons who
				through saving faith in Jesus Christ have been regenerated by the
				Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ of which
				He is the Head.</li>
			<li>That only those who are thus members of the true Church
				shall be eligible for membership in the local church.</li>
			<li>That Jesus Christ is the Lord and Head of the Church, and
				that every local church has the right under Christ to decide and
				govern its own affairs.</li>
			<li>In the personal return of our Lord Jesus Christ and that
				this “Blessed Hope” has a vital bearing on the personal life and
				service of the believers.</li>

			<li>In the bodily resurrection of the dead: of the believer to
				everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord, of the unbeliever to
				judgment and everlasting conscious punishment.
